# Identity & Context
You are working on mathtrail-solution-validator — the validation engine that checks student solutions.
This service performs exact matching, symbolic equivalence, and step-by-step validation.
It is STATELESS — no database.

Tech Stack: Go or Python (Python preferred for SymPy), Dapr pub/sub over Kafka
Port: 8080
Infra: infra/helm/mathtrail-solution-validator/

# Communication Map
Dapr App ID: mathtrail-solution-validator
Inbound:
  - REST API: POST /validate
  - Dapr service invocation from UI
Outbound:
  - Dapr invoke → mathtrail-task (get solution reference)
  - Dapr pub/sub: publishes `task.attempt.completed` (result for Profile + Mentor)
Secrets (Vault): None

# Development Standards
- Validation must support multiple strategies: exact match, numeric tolerance, symbolic equivalence
- All validation logic must be pure functions (no side effects)
- Feedback must include: correct/incorrect, partial credit, hints
- If using Python: type hints required, use pytest
- If using Go: handle errors explicitly, use testify

# Commit Convention
Use Conventional Commits: feat(validator):, fix(validator):, test(validator):
Example: feat(validator): add symbolic equivalence via SymPy

# Testing Strategy
Run: `just test` (or `pytest` if Python)
Unit tests: Each validation strategy must have comprehensive test cases
Math correctness tests: Known problem/solution pairs with edge cases
Priority: Unit tests 95%, Integration tests 5%
Validator correctness is critical — extensive test coverage required
